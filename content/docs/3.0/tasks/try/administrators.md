In this guide, you'll learn how to quickly get a tiny TiKV cluster running locally, then you'll learn how to do some basic administrative tasks with the cluster. You'll also learn some common configuration options and when you might want to use them.

This guide will talk briefly about security, resiliency, and production readiness, but these topics are covered much more in depth in the [deploy](../../deploy/introduction) guides. This guide won't discuss interacting with data within TiKV itself (see the [developers](../developers) guide) or developing TiKV itself (See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).) Instead, this guide will try to introduce you to what it's like to administrate TiKV.
