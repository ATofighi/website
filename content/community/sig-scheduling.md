Scheduling SIG covers the scheduling system for TiKV. Our work includes

- supporting new scheduling policies and optimizing the existing scheduling systems

## How to get involved

You can take a look at our [Wiki](https://github.com/tikv/pd/wiki) to learn about some basic concepts and pick up an issue or raise a proposal in [Scheduling SIG project](https://github.com/tikv/pd/projects/5).

Also, you can join us in #sig-scheduling in the [TiKV community Slack](https://slack.tidb.io/invite?team=tikv-wg&channel=sig-scheduling&ref=github-sig) to discuss everything about the scheduling of distributed system. We use English and Chinese.
