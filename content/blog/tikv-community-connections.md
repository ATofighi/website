A few months ago at [TiDB DevCon](https://pingcap.com/community-cn/devcon2019/) we talked about how we'd be opening new TiKV community forums & a community chat.

We're very happy to say you can now join us at [forum.tikv.org](http://forum.tikv.org/) for forums, and the [tikv-wg slack](https://join.slack.com/t/tikv-wg/shared_invite/enQtNTUyODE4ODU2MzI0LTgzZDQ3NzZlNDkzMGIyYjU1MTA0NzIwMjFjODFiZjA0YjFmYmQyOTZiNzNkNzg1N2U1MDdlZTIxNTU5NWNhNjk) for chat.

We're happy to have these spaces for our community to discuss and share. During our planning we realized that a syncronous space such as Slack or Discord offer a good place for ephemeral *conversation*, *discussion*, and *troubleshooting*, while spaces such as forums or Discourse offer a semi-permanent space for sharing *articles*, *stories*, and *guides*.

Please respect our [code of conduct](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in these spaces.

This space isn't just for TiKV! You'll also find topics for some of TiKVs dependencies as well: `raft-rs`, `gRPC-rs`, `rust-prometheus`, and `fail-rs`.

The site is still quite young and empty, but we'd love to have you join us and share.
